# Welcome to SlimeVR

SlimeVR is low cost solution to Full Body Tracking for use in SteamVR, using sensors to send data to Steam instead of relying on line of sight. This means sitting in chairs, lying down and even covering yourself with a blanket is not an issue.

## How does it work?
SlimeVR FBT is a set of trackers and software that provide simple, effective tracking of the user’s body in VR and other applications. By using high-quality IMU sensors connected to PC over wifi, SlimeVR makes comfortable full-body tracking possible without wires, cameras, or base stations. Five trackers on the waist, thighs, and ankles track their rotation in space, then SlimeVR uses your proportions and headset position to calculate your joints, and tracks position using this info. In more technical terms, SlimeVR uses absolute orientation sensors and a skeleton model with user-entered proportions and forward kinematics to put virtual Vive trackers on key points.

The base set of 5 trackers lets the user track their lower body (legs and waist), which is a physical area widely supported by VR games like VRChat. Other games like NeosVR, LIV, and more can track knees and chest using the same trackers. Additional trackers can be used to increase tracking to the users feet, elbows, chests, and full hands position.

## Focused on Accessibility and Comfort
The main focus of this project is the user’s comfort. The sensors are lightweight and easy to wear, cannot be obscured, and provide a wide range of motion. Slime VR does not need cameras, other external sensors or base stations.

Open source design gives power to the VR community to expand on the SlimeVR ecosystem, create new devices, add compatibility with new software, and improve upon all aspects of the project in the future.


## Compatibility
- PC VR games with Full Body Tracking support such as:
  - VRChat
  - NeosVR
  - Blade & Sorcery
- Streaming VR games with an avatar
- Steam VR games
And much more as we grow!

## What about the Oculus Quest?
The Oculus Quest itself, as a standalone system, doesn’t support full body tracking right now. However, you can use SlimeVR with your Oculus Quest if you connect it to PC and play SteamVR games with it!

## Open Source
You can find our open source software and firmware in our GitHub repository. Open source hardware schematics will be available when the campaign goes live, with a final version coming at a later date. We also plan to supply additional schematics and instructions for an easier DIY version. Some of the people in our community are already making DIY SlimeVR trackers!
