# Updating the tracker firmware

This procedure will show how to build and configure the SlimeVR firmware, as well as how to upload it to your tracker.

**1. [Install and setup your environment](setup-and-install.md)**

You'll need to install Visual Studio Code, the PlatformIO extension and the drivers required for the project. You will also need to clone the firmware's repo. [Full details of how to do this process can be found here.](setup-and-install.md)

**2. [Configure and build the firmware](configuring-project.md)**

Using the environment set up in the last step, you will need to build your firmware based on the specifications of your tracker. [Full details of how to do this process can be found here.](configuring-project.md)


**3. [Upload the firmware](upload-firmware.md)**

The built firmware from the last step can then be uploaded to the tracker. [Full details of how to do this process can be found here.](upload-firmware.md)
