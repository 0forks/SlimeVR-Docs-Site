# Uploading the firmware

## 1. Plug in your ESP

If your microcontroller board has a button labeled `FLASH`, `BOOT` or `RESET`, press and hold the button and plug in the micro-USB cable. If you have different labels and/or buttons, please check your microcontroller's manual for more information.

Note that holding the button is not required for Wemos D1 Mini.


## 2. Upload your firmware

* Once the firmware has been built, press the upload button to upload the firmware.
